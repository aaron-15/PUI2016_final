PUI2016_RULES
This exam is take home. Deliver your solution as an ipython notebook uploading it to NYUclasses BY 12/20/2016 at 9:00 AM on [NYUclasses](https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/117cb090-5a95-4c21-ae3b-1689f142f714/page/b024aa3e-e0b6-4e83-869c-d25fe12a66ff)
Work alone. If you have questions feel free to ask them to your instructors and TAs on the [slack channel] (https://pui2016final.slack.com/). High level intellectual discussion is never forbidden, so general, conceptual questions can be discussed with your class mates, but do not exchange code, or algorithms (specific solution design).

There are shortcuts: for example you can use census data that is already wrangled and merged. Make sure you notice the shortcuts!
